# Function App Slot Hybrid Connection example

This example demonstrates how to configure hybrid connections for Function App deployment slots. It creates:

- A Windows Function App with a deployment slot
- An Azure Relay namespace and hybrid connection
- A hybrid connection configuration between the Function App slot and the on-premises endpoint

This pattern allows Function App slots to securely connect to on-premises resources through Azure Relay.
