# Web App Slot Hybrid Connection example

This example demonstrates how to configure hybrid connections for Web App deployment slots. It creates:

- A Windows Web App with a deployment slot
- An Azure Relay namespace and hybrid connection
- A hybrid connection configuration between the Web App slot and the on-premises endpoint

This pattern allows Web App slots to securely connect to on-premises resources through Azure Relay.
